This was written for the [Random hacks of kindness
hackathon](http://www.rhok.org/event/montr%C3%A9al-canada-0) in Montreal 2012.
It was written in less that 48 hours, and polished up a bit after the event.

Its still a bit rough around the edges and largely untested (I only wrote tests
for the changes I made after the hack).

What is it?
